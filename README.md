# YAIM0425 d01b – 1x1 Entities

---

## 📌 Description

**YAIM0425 d01b – 1x1 Entities** lets you place **full‑size machines in a 1×1 tile space**, making your factories much more compact and flexible.

With this MOD enabled, many common machines automatically get a **miniaturized version** that works just like the original, but takes only **one tile** instead of several. This allows you to:

* Build extremely compact factories
* Fit machines in tight or irregular spaces
* Reduce belt and pipe clutter
* Experiment with new factory layouts

The MOD works automatically in the background. You don’t need to configure anything: just research or craft the new 1×1 versions and start using them.

Supported machines include (depending on what MODs you have installed):

* Assemblers
* Furnaces (including electric furnaces)
* Mining drills
* Beacons
* Solar panels
* Accumulators
* Reactors
* Boilers and generators
* Turrets and radars
* Storage tanks

Each 1×1 machine has its **own item, recipe, and technology**, clearly marked so you can easily recognize them in‑game.
